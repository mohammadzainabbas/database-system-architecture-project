#### 1. Introduction

Range types in PostgreSQL are data types for representing a continuous interval of values. Interestingly range types can be instantiated with a subtype, then they express intervals of this subtype. For instance, ranges of timestamp is a time interval, e.g. the lecture slot. Clearly the subtystrictly left ofpe must have a total order so that it is well-defined whether element values are within, before, or after a range of values.

In this project, we are aiming to develop  Range Types: Statistics, Selectivity and Join Estimations

PostgreSQL (a.k.a _Postgres_) is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally named _POSTGRES_, referring to its origins as a successor to the _Ingres_ database developed at the _University of California, Berkeley_.
